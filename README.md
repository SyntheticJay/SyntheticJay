# Hey!

## âœ¨  About Me
My Name's Jay. There isn't much to know about me but I'm from the UK and I love to code stuff, primarily in `python`, `java` and `C#`. It's been almost 3 years since I started this journey in computer science, and I created this profile to show off some of my ability. I'm always striving to better my code, improve my workrate and most of all achieve my dream of becoming a software engineer. 

There is still a long way to go, but I have patence! 

## ðŸ’Ž Primary Projects
Currently as of now, I am heavily working on a discord bot called `Cannabot`. It's a strain search engine and education provider about Cannabis. With over 1970+ strains to explore, I hope to provide the small but heavily inspirational community with a bit of my own creativity and knowledge about what I know best.
