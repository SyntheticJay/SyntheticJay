# Hey!

## âœ¨  About Me
My Name's Jay. There isn't much to know about me but I'm from the UK and I love to code stuff, primarily in `python`, `java`, `C#`, `node.js`, `TypeScript` and `PHP` . It's been almost 4 years since I started this journey in computer science, and I created this profile to show off some of my ability. I'm always striving to better my code, improve my workrate and most of all achieve my dream of becoming a software engineer. 

There is still a long way to go, but I have patience!
